Jan is an open-source desktop application that serves as a privacy-focused alternative to ChatGPT, allowing users to download and run large language models (like Llama, Gemma, and Qwen) entirely offline on their local machines while also supporting cloud integrations with providers like OpenAI and Anthropic. The key feature for my project is that Jan exposes an OpenAI-compatible API server at localhost:1337, which means other applications can connect to it programmatically.
In my ZeroconfAI project, I'm using Jan as a demonstration client to showcase the protocol's versatility—my C++ local proxy server discovers multiple AI services on the network via mDNS (like local Ollama instances or cloud provider gateways), then exposes a single stable OpenAI-compatible endpoint that Jan can connect to, effectively turning Jan's UI into a front-end for distributed AI services discovered through ZeroconfAI.
